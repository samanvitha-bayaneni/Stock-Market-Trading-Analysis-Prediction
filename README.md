- **Research Focus**: The project investigates the 1992 stock market crash in India and its role in shaping economic reforms that propelled India into a leading market among developing nations. It specifically examines the involvement of eight companies: ACC, Apollo, BPL, Hero, Reliance, Sterlite, Tata, and Videocon.
  
- **Analysis Approach**: The project employs non-technical and technical analyses. Non-technical analysis looks at the companies' histories and public perceptions, while technical analysis includes stock price prediction, historical trends, daily returns, moving averages, correlations, risk assessment, and future price prediction using deep learning techniques like RNN and LSTM.
  
- **Economic Impact**: The project also explores how stock price fluctuations impact India's economy, with a focus on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) values, illustrating the connection between the stock market and the broader economic landscape.
